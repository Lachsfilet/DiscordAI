# DiscordAI Bot 

This bot was made with a template from  [dominikdev (Discord)](https://discord.com/users/347077478726238228) [mezotv (GitHub)](https://github.com/mezotv) ([Template URL](https://github.com/mezotv/Discord-Bot-Template))

This bot offers a command (/cavefolk) which requires a prompt and answers to it like a caveman.

It is free of use you just need to get an OpenAI Api key and a Discord Bot with Token and fill out the example.env and rename to .env.

For further documentation or context I can just refer to the [Template](https://github.com/mezotv/Discord-Bot-Template) which was used here.
